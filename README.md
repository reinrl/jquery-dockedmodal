A simple & lightweight method of displaying docked (visually tied to an element) modal windows with jQuery.

# Why another modal plugin?

Most plugins I've found try to do too much, and have specialized ways of handling photo galleries, iframes and video.  The resulting HTML & CSS is often bloated and difficult to customize.

By contrast, this plugin handles the two most common scenarios I run into

* displaying an existing DOM element
* loading a page with AJAX

and does so with as little HTML & CSS as possible.

# Installation

Use it the good old fashioned way of including the scripts & styles manually:

```html
<script src="jquery.dockedmodal.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.dockedmodal.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />
```

_(You'll obviously need to include jQuery as well)._

**jQuery Requirements:** jQuery 1.7 is required.

# Opening

#### Method 1: Automatically attaching to links

The simplest approach is to add `rel="dockedmodal:open"` to your links and use the `href` attribute to specify what to open in the modal.

Open an existing DOM element by ID:

```html
<form id="login-form" class="dockedmodal">
  ...
</form>

<a href="#login-form" rel="dockedmodal:open">Login</a>
```

Load a remote URL with AJAX:

```html
<a href="login.html" rel="dockedmodal:open">Login</a>
```

#### Method 2: Manually

You can manually open a modal by calling the `.dockedmodal()` method on the element:

```html
<form id="login-form" class="dockedmodal">
  ...
</form>
```

```js
$('#login-form').dockedmodal();
```

You can also invoke `.dockedmodal()` directly on links:

```html
<a href="#ex5" data-dockedmodal>Open a DOM element</a>
<a href="ajax.html" data-dockedmodal>Open an AJAX modal</a>
```

```js
$('a[data-dockedmodal]').click(function(event) {
  $(this).dockedmodal();
  return false;
});
```

### Compatibility Fallback

You can provide a clean fallback for users who have JavaScript disabled by manually attaching the modal via the `data-dockedmodal` attribute. This allows you to write your links pointing to the `href` as normal (fallback) while enabling modals where JavaScript is enabled.

```html
<!-- By default link takes user to /login.html -->
<a href="/login.html" data-dockedmodal="#login-modal">Login</a>

<!-- Login modal embedded in page -->
<div id="login-modal" class="dockedmodal">
  ...
</div>

<!-- For browsers with JavaScript, open the modal. -->
<script>
  $(function() {
    $('a[data-dockedmodal]').on('click', function() {
      $($(this).data('modal')).dockedmodal();
      return false;
    });
  });
</script>
```

#### Fade Transitions

By default the overlay & window appear instantaneously, but you can enable a fade effect by specifying the `fadeDuration` option.

```js
$('a.open-dockedmodal').click(function(event) {
  $(this).dockedmodal({
    fadeDuration: 250
  });
  return false;
});
```

This will fade in the overlay and modal over 250 milliseconds _simultaneously._ If you want the effect of the overlay appearing _before_ the window, you can specify the `fadeDelay` option. This indicates at what point during the overlay transition the window transition should begin.

So if you wanted the window to fade in when the overlay's was 80% finished:

```js
$(elm).dockedmodal({
  fadeDuration: 250,
  fadeDelay: 0.80
});
```

Or, if you wanted the window to fade in a few moments after the overlay transition has completely finished:

```js
$(elm).dockedmodal({
  fadeDuration: 250,
  fadeDelay: 1.5
});
```

The `fadeDelay` option only applies when opening the modal. When closing the modal, both the modal and the overlay fade out simultaneously according to the `fadeDuration` setting.

Fading is the only supported transition.

# Closing

Because there can be only one modal active at a single time, there's no need to select which modal to close:

```js
$.dockedmodal.close();
```

Similar to how links can be automatically bound to open modals, they can be bound to close modals using `rel="dockedmodal:close"`:

```html
<a href="#close" rel="dockedmodal:close">Close window</a>
```

_(Note that modals loaded with AJAX are removed from the DOM when closed)._

# Checking current state

* Use `$.dockedmodal.isActive()` to check if a modal is currently being displayed.
* Use `$.dockedmodal.getCurrent()` to retrieve a reference to the currently active modal instance, if any.

# Options

These are the supported options and their default values:

```js
$.dockedmodal.defaults = {
  closeExisting: true,    // Close existing modals. Set this to false if you need to stack multiple modal instances.
  escapeClose: true,      // Allows the user to close the modal by pressing `ESC`
  clickClose: true,       // Allows the user to close the modal by clicking the overlay
  closeText: 'Close',     // Text content for the close <a> tag.
  closeClass: '',         // Add additional class(es) to the close <a> tag.
  showClose: true,        // Shows a (X) icon/link in the top-right corner
  modalClass: "dockedmodal",    // CSS class added to the element being displayed in the modal.
  spinnerHtml: null,      // HTML appended to the default spinner during AJAX requests.
  showSpinner: true,      // Enable/disable the default spinner during AJAX requests.
  fadeDuration: null,     // Number of milliseconds the fade transition takes (null means no transition)
  fadeDelay: 1.0,         // Point during the overlay's fade-in that the modal begins to fade in (.5 = 50%, 1.5 = 150%, etc.)
  scrollToTop: false      // Keeps body overflow visible, body scrolling enabled, is set to true. Default is false.
};
```

# Events

The following events are triggered on the modal element at various points in the open/close cycle (see below for AJAX events).

```javascript
$.dockedmodal.BEFORE_BLOCK = 'dockedmodal:before-block';    // Fires just before the overlay (blocker) appears.
$.dockedmodal.BLOCK = 'dockedmodal:block';                  // Fires after the overlay (block) is visible.
$.dockedmodal.BEFORE_OPEN = 'dockedmodal:before-open';      // Fires just before the modal opens.
$.dockedmodal.OPEN = 'dockedmodal:open';                    // Fires after the modal has finished opening.
$.dockedmodal.BEFORE_CLOSE = 'dockedmodal:before-close';    // Fires when the modal has been requested to close.
$.dockedmodal.CLOSE = 'dockedmodal:close';                  // Fires when the modal begins closing (including animations).
$.dockedmodal.AFTER_CLOSE = 'dockedmodal:after-close';      // Fires after the modal has fully closed (including animations).
```

The first and only argument passed to these event handlers is the `modal` object, which has three properties:

```js
dockedmodal.$elm;       // Original jQuery object upon which modal() was invoked.
dockedmodal.options;    // Options passed to the modal.
dockedmodal.$blocker;   // The overlay element.
```

So, you could do something like this:

```js
$('#purchase-form').on($.dockedmodal.BEFORE_CLOSE, function(event, modal) {
  clear_shopping_cart();
});
```

# AJAX

## Basic support

jQuery Modal uses $.get for basic AJAX support. A simple spinner will be displayed by default (if you've included dockedmodal.css) and will have the class `dockedmodal-spinner`. If you've set the `modalClass` option, the spinner will be prefixed with that class name instead.

You can add text or additional HTML to the spinner with the `spinnerHtml` option, or disable the spinner entirely by setting `showSpinner: false`.

## Events

The following events are triggered when AJAX modals are requested.

```js
$.dockedmodal.AJAX_SEND = 'dockedmodal:ajax:send';
$.dockedmodal.AJAX_SUCCESS = 'dockedmodal:ajax:success';
$.dockedmodal.AJAX_FAIL = 'dockedmodal:ajax:fail';
$.dockedmodal.AJAX_COMPLETE = 'dockedmodal:ajax:complete';
```

The handlers receive no arguments. The events are triggered on the `<a>` element which initiated the AJAX modal.

## More advanced AJAX handling

It's a good idea to provide more robust AJAX handling -- error handling, in particular. Instead of accommodating the myriad [`$.ajax` options](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) jQuery provides, jquery-dockedmodal makes it possible to directly modify the AJAX request itself.

Simply bypass the default AJAX handling (i.e.: don't use `rel="dockedmodal"`)

```html
<a href="ajax.html" rel="ajax:dockedmodal">Click me!</a>
```

and make your AJAX request in the link's click handler. Note that you need to manually append the new HTML/modal in the `success` callback:

```js
$('a[rel="ajax:dockedmodal"]').click(function(event) {

  $.ajax({

    url: $(this).attr('href'),

    success: function(newHTML, textStatus, jqXHR) {
      $(newHTML).appendTo('body').dockedmodal();
    },

    error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
      // Handle AJAX errors
    }

    // More AJAX customization goes here.

  });

  return false;
});
```

Note that the AJAX response must be wrapped in a div with class <code>dockedmodal</code> when using the second (manual) method.
